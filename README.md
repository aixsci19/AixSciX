# AI & DeSci Token Project

## Overview

AI & DeSci Token is a cutting-edge cryptocurrency project designed to revolutionize the fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Decentralized Science (DeSci). By integrating blockchain technology with AI-driven solutions, this project aims to provide secure, transparent, and efficient ways to fund, share, and develop scientific research globally.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Research Funding:** Seamless and transparent funding for scientific projects through smart contracts.
- **AI-Powered Data Analysis:** Advanced AI algorithms for rapid and accurate scientific data processing.
- **Immutable Data Storage:** Secure and tamper-proof storage of research data on the blockchain.
- **Global Collaboration:** Enabling researchers worldwide to collaborate without intermediaries.
- **Incentive Mechanism:** Reward system for contributors, validators, and investors.
- **IP Protection with NFTs:** Safeguarding intellectual property rights through NFT integration.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-desci-token.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ai-desci-token
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment variables:
   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```
   Example content for `.env`:
   ```env
   PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
   INFURA_API_KEY=your_infura_api_key
   ```
5. Compile the smart contracts:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```
6. Deploy smart contracts:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network network_name
   ```

## Usage

- Interact with smart contracts via the provided user interface.
- Stake tokens to support scientific projects.
- Access and contribute to decentralized research data.
